# rpctimehttp

    go get github.com/daved/rpctimehttp

Package rpctimehttp is an HTTP API server making use of the 
github.com/daved/rpctime microservice.  It is a trivial example and does not 
resolve many common concerns with production-ready apps or microservices.

## Usage

    rpctimehttp [--http-port={:29876}] [--rpc-port={:19876}]
