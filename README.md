udpbasic is a simple example of listening on a port for UDP packets, then
printing the output.  udpbasic is listening on :33233.

## Run

   udpbasic

## Interact

    nc -u 127.0.0.1 33233
    // then type things

Packet sizes can be adjusted according to need.  This is incredibly basic, but
can be the basis for a more complex project.
