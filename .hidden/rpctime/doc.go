// Package rpctime is an RPC client and server library, and also includes an
// implementation of the server within `./cmd/rpctime`. It is a trivial example
// and does not resolve many common concerns with production-ready
// microservices.

// An example implementation of the client code is available at
// https://github.com/daved/rpctimehttp.
